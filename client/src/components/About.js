      <h2 id='introduction'>Introduction</h2>
      <div className='p'>In distributed multiplayer gaming, the client-server
        model has long
        been the dominant architecture. Clients send inputs to a central server
        that updates the game state accordingly and provides an authoritative
        view of the game to all connected clients. If a conflict arises between
        a player’s local state and the server state, the client must accept the
        server’s view of the game. Having a single source of truth guarantees
        consistency, meaning that all players will experience the same game
        state.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>Peer-to-peer gaming, on the other hand, has no central
        server that can
        offer this guarantee, but is nonetheless intriguing for several
        reasons:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>P2P architectures are cheaper to build and maintain because they
          rely on peers’ resources (processing, storage, network) rather than
          dedicated remote systems
        </li>
        <li>P2P architectures are trustless</li>
        <li>P2P architectures have no inherent single point of failure and offer
          high availability
        </li>
        <li>P2P architectures can offer the lowest latency by eliminating
          intermediaries
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div className='p'>These are significant advantages, both for players and
        game developers.
        However, P2P gaming also poses many challenges:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the security risks of P2P communications?</li>
        <li>How do we mitigate the effects of latency resulting from
          geographical separation?
        </li>
        <li>Without the authority of a central server, how is consistency of
          game state maintained?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div className='p'>Our project, Ouroboros, is a real-time peer-to-peer
        multiplayer snake
        game that was created to take on some of these challenges and explore
        this brave new world. We chose to implement a snake game because we
        wanted to push the limits of using the WebRTC data channel for
        time-critical communications while keeping game logic relatively simple.
        Turn-based games provide natural delays that mitigate the challenges of
        working with direct peer-to-peer communications, but our snake game must
        proceed relentlessly and smoothly forward regardless of latency and
        peer disconnections. Our use case necessitated efficiency of both local
        processing and peer-to-peer messaging, a prediction algorithm to fill in
        missing peer data, and data structures and algorithms that could ensure
        eventual consistency across all peers.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>In summary, our main challenges were</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Synchronization</li>
        <li>Providing smooth gameplay even with missing peer data</li>
        <li>Replicating the game state across all peers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id='background-webrtc'>Getting Started: Connecting Peers with
        WebRTC</h2>
      <div className='p'>Peer-to-peer communication has been available natively
        in some browsers
        since the introduction of WebRTC in 2010. WebRTC is a peer-to-peer API
        that is now supported natively in all major browsers
        <Citation
          creator='CanIUse.com'
          url='https://caniuse.com/#search=webrtc'
          comment='Accessed April 19, 2018'
        />
        and enables users to build P2P applications with media and data streams.
        Most existing WebRTC applications make use of media streams in the area
        of audio- and video-conferencing, while the WebRTC data channel is
        typically used to support an accompanying chat box. However, the data
        channel is highly configurable and has a variety of use-cases, including
        online gaming.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>In Ouroboros, we use a link-sharing model to make
        connections between
        peers. When a user sends an initial request to our server, a WebSocket
        connection is established and the app registers its location (public IP
        address) with the server. The server then assigns a random, unique ID to
        the user which is used by the app to create a sharing link that is
        displayed in the user interface. When a new peer follows the link, the
        ID is extracted from the URL and is passed to the server to request a
        connection to the peer that it represents. Once a connection is
        established between the two peers, a WebRTC data channel is opened and
        direct peer-to-peer messaging can begin.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>Under the hood, establishing a peer-to-peer connection
        over WebRTC is a
        multi-step process. After a user follows a sharing link to the game
        site, she sends a request to a STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for
        NAT) server to determine her public IP address and whether or not she is
        accessible behind her router’s NAT (Network Address Translation). If she
        is accessible, a direct connection is created between her and the peer
        associated with the ID in the sharing link. If she is not accessible, a
        TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server must act as an
        intermediary between her and her peers, such that it is not a direct
        peer-to-peer connection.

      <h2 id='synchronization'>Synchronization</h2>
      <div className='p'>Latency will always prevent peers from being precisely
        synchronized,
        but an approximation is necessary for a multiplayer game to be coherent.
        In order to implement synchrony, we introduced sequence numbers that we
        call ‘time units’ or TUs.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>One TU corresponds to a snake moving forward by one
        square. Each
        instance of the game has a local timer that increments the TU after a
        regular interval. The real-time length of this interval is currently
        250ms (a quarter of a second), which was determined by balancing
        performance considerations and user experience.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>When messages are sent to other peers, TUs are used as
        keys for snake
        position coordinates:
      </div>
      <SyntaxHighlighter {...syntaxHighlighterProps}>
        {tuKeysCode}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>
      <div className='p'>When the message is received, the receiving peer will
        incorporate this
        data into their local data structures, using the TUs to synchronize this
        snake’s data with that of the other snakes in the game.
      </div>
      <h3 id='tus-and-snake-bodies'>TUs and Snake Bodies</h3>
      <div className='p'>In the classic snake game (and ours), the body of the
        snake follows the
        path of the head, so the coordinates of the body represent the history
        of the coordinates of the head. For example, if a snake is 5 squares
        long, those 5 squares are the current position of the head plus the
        previous 4 positions. Therefore, to represent the position of each snake
        we track the coordinates of the head and store that history, tagging
        each with a TU. The snake’s body is the coordinate pair at the current
        TU (the head) plus as many of the coordinates from previous TUs as
        needed given the current length of the snake.

      <h3 id='collision-checking'>Collision Checking</h3>
      <div className='p'>In our game, a collision is defined as the head of your
        own snake
        occupying the same coordinates as a peer snake or another part of your
        own body. So, in order to check for collisions, we must aggregate peer
        snake positions and the position of your own snake, minus its head, into
        a board. Then, we simply check the coordinates of the head against this
        aggregate. If that position is occupied, there has been a collision and
        your snake is now dead.
      </div>
      <h3 id='living-snake-count-and-end-of-game'>Living Snake Count and End of
        Game</h3>
      <div className='p'>A count of living snakes is maintained throughout the
        game. Each time a
        peer snake dies, the count is decremented. Maintaining this count allows
        us to check for the game over conditions with minimal processing. In a
        single-player game, the game ends when the sole snake dies. In a
        multi-player game, the game ends when one or zero snakes remain (two
        snakes may die simultaneously in a head-on collision).
      </div>
      <h3 id='death-buffer'>Death Buffer</h3>
      <div className='p'>When your snake dies, you announce a TU of death to
        your peers. This is
        immediately captured in your peers&apos; local snake data structure,
        but their living snake count is not decremented if they have not yet
        reached the TU at which your snake died. In that case, the TU is added
        to the death buffer. At every TU tick, the death buffer is checked and
        any corresponding deaths are applied by decrementing the living snake
        count accordingly.
      </div>
      <h3 id='game-over-buffer'>Game Over Buffer</h3>
      <div className='p'>When the game over condition is reached, a player will
        announce this to
        the other players after a short delay. The delay is put in place to
        allow the announcing player to receive any pending peer messages so that
        the winner(s) is/are identified as accurately as possible. When players
        receive a game over announcement flagged with a TU, if the player has
        not yet reached this TU, this message is diverted to the game over
        buffer. Just like the death buffer, the game over buffer is checked with
        every TU tick and any corresponding game over announcement is applied.
        This allows players that are slightly out of sync with their peers to
        complete the last few moves of the game, allowing all peers to have a
        more complete and accurate view of the final game state.
      </div>
      <h3 id='tus-for-latency-tolerance'>TUs for Latency Tolerance</h3>
      <div className='p'>In order to ensure a good user experience, it is
        necessary to impose a
        latency threshold. There are mechanisms in place (discussed later) to
        provide smooth gameplay despite some latency. However, too much latency
        makes the game unplayable. Periodically, the local TU timer is compared
        to the most recent TUs from each peer snake. If the discrepancy between
        the local timer and a peer’s most recent TU exceeds latency threshold,
        that peer is removed from the current game; their snake is marked as
        dead, and they are shown an ‘out-of-sync’ message.
      </div>
      <h2 id='smooth-gameplay-with-missing-peer-data'>Smooth Gameplay with
        Missing Peer Data</h2>
      <div className='p'>Network latency & interruptions can delay P2P messages,
        which means
        that peer data may not always be available when it is needed. How do we
        ensure a smooth gaming experience when peer data is missing?
      </div>
      <div className='p'>The lockstep model of peer-to-peer gaming ensures
        consistency of game
        state across all peers by waiting for all peer data before moving the
        game
        state forward. However, this method causes all players to move at the
        speed of the player with the most latency and therefore will often
        result
        in a slow and irregular pace. This model is entirely incompatible with a
        fast, reflex-based game like ours, which must proceed at a quick and
        steady pace to be enjoyable for players.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>Because we cannot wait for data, we must be able to
        predict avatar
        movements when peer data is absent. Then, when new peer data is
        received,
        these predictions must be discarded and new data must be incorporated
        into
        existing data structures. The process of predicting peer positions and
        then reconciling new peer data with these predictions is called dead
        reckoning, and it is used in many kinds of multiplayer games.

        Using predictions means that a player’s view of the game will not always
        be precisely accurate and it will temporarily diverge from the view of
        the other peers, but it allows for smooth, fast gameplay and any
        discrepancies are only temporary (more on this below). Moreover, this
        technique is a good fit for a snake game because the snake will continue
        moving in a single direction until its owner instructs it to do
        otherwise, making it easy for players to predict the other snakes’
        movements with a fairly high degree of accuracy.

      <div className='p'>A snake avatar moves forward until its player tells it
        to change
        direction by pressing an arrow key. As we have seen, the position of a
        snake’s head is represented by row-column coordinates. The next position
        can be calculated with the last known coordinates and direction. If the
        top-left square is <code>&#123;row: 0, column: 0&#125;</code> and your
        snake’s head coordinates are <code>&#123;row: 5, column: 3&#125;</code>,
        it works like this:

      <h3 id='convergence-technique'>Convergence Technique</h3>
      <div className='p'>When our predictions do not match the actual peer data
        that is later
        received, we need a convergence technique to reconcile the
        discrepancies. The easiest solution to resolving these differences is to
        keep predictions and canonical data separate. In this way, the board
        that the player sees is a mix of canonical data and disposable
        predictions, while the data they hold for each peer’s snake is kept in a
        separate structure and is only updated with real data from the peer.
        Every time snakes advance one square on the board, we discard the old
        board data, redraw the board with any new peer data, and then apply any
        necessary predictions.
      </div>
      <h3 id='predictions-and-collision-checking'>Predictions and Collision
        Checking</h3>
      <div className='p'>Predicted data is not used for collision checking. As a
        result,
        apparent collisions in the board may not be confirmed by real peer data
        and will not cause a snake to die. Although this policy may seem
        counterintuitive in terms of user experience, it is necessary to
        preserve consistency across peers. Predictions are constantly corrected
        by incoming peer data, which means that observed collisions will be also
        be corrected, allowing players to understand the discrepancy and the
        resulting behavior.
      </div>

      <h2 id='authority-and-consistency'>Authority and Consistency</h2>
      <div className='p'>A client-server game uses its authoritative central
        server to ensure a
        consistent game state for all players. So who is the authority in a
        peer-to-peer game? In Ouroboros, each peer functions as the authority
        for his/her own avatar. Each time a move is committed (corresponding to
        a TU tick), this information is broadcast to the other peers. Each peer
        must then efficiently incorporate this data into her local data
        structure in such a way that eventual consistency is ensured.
      </div>
      <h3 id='peer-to-peer-messaging-transport-protocol'>Peer-to-Peer Messaging
        Transport Protocol</h3>
      <div className='p'>The WebRTC data channel is implemented with Stream
        Control Transmission
        Protocol (SCTP), which can be configured to behave like TCP or UDP
        depending on the desired functionality. Using a reliable TCP-like
        configuration ensures ordered delivery of packets. Although this seems
        highly desirable, reliability is currently implemented by mandating a
        series of confirmation and counter-confirmation messages from the
        involved parties, which would result in excessive peer-to-peer chatter
        that would take priority and most likely cause delays for game-relevant
        messages.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>Given the limitations of reliable messaging and its
        potential impact on
        performance, we needed to choose the unreliable, UDP-like configuration
        for our peer-to-peer messages. However, this decision meant that we
        needed to implement ways to deal with lost and/or unordered messages.

      <div className='p'>As we discussed above, if a snake’s current position is
        known, only a
        directional command is needed to know its next position. This suggests
        that once all snakes’ starting positions are known, peer-to-peer
        messages need only contain directional commands (operations). However,
        with an unreliable transport protocol messages can be delayed, received
        out of order, duplicated, or lost altogether. So, for example, if a
        player sends <code>left, right, up</code> for their snake, one peer may
        receive only <code>left, up</code>, while another receives <code>left,
          up, right</code> and a third receives <code>left, left, right</code>.
        These discrepancies will cause the position of that snake to be very
        different for the three peers, resulting in incoherent gameplay.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>It is clear that sending directional commands alone can
        easily
        introduce state distortions and that this approach does not provide the
        means to detect and resolve these inconsistencies. A solution is that
        each peer broadcast not only directional commands, but also coordinate
        pairs keyed by TUs for synchronization.

        Absolute coordinates provide much more robust data than relative
        directional commands, and TUs allow us to coordinate data between all
        the peers.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>Moreover, we need strategies to prevent data loss when
        messages are
        dropped, and to keep the game state from being distorted when messages
        are duplicated or received out of order.
      </div>
      <h3 id='overlap-and-redundancy-in-peer-messages'>Overlap and Redundancy in
        Peer Messages</h3>
      <div className='p'>Because our messaging protocol does not guarantee that
        messages will be
        received, we must structure our messaging to provide redundancy so that
        dropped messages do not result in data loss. So, with each TU tick, each
        player broadcasts a range of coordinates including the most recent (the
        current position of the snake’s head). Although one message may be lost,
        a regular stream of overlapping updates helps to ensure that all
        information will eventually be received anyway.

        CRDT</h3>
      <div className='p'>A conflict-free replicated data type, or <b>CRDT</b>,
        is any
        distributed data structure that guarantees eventual consistency of
        replicas that are updated independently and without direct coordination.
        CRDTs are used by no-SQL databases (ex. Redis and Riak) and
        collaborative text editors (ex. Atom’s Teletype). There are two types of
        CRDTs: operation-based and state-based. Operation-based CRDTs require
        reliable messaging that prevents duplicates. Because this is not an
        option for our use case, we require a state-based CRDT. Also known as a
        convergent replicated data type (CvRDT), a state-based CRDT must merge
        new data with the local state with operations that
        are <b>idempotent</b> (repeating the same operation produces the same
        result), <b>commutative</b> (operations can be done in any order),
        and <b>associative</b> (operations can be grouped in any way).
        Restricting operations to meet these criteria ensures that accurate
        replicas can be created for all peers even when messages are duplicated
        or received out of order.

        Whenever new snake data is received, any TUs newer than
        existing data are simply added to the collection. Changes in direction
        are made whenever the most recent TU in the message is the same or
        greater than the most recent TU in the local data structure.

      <div className='p'>So, if the current state of <code>snake 1</code> is...

        strictly follow the constraints of a CRDT because it could introduce
        discrepancies between peers, but the nature of the game means that data
        from TUs that are more than a few seconds in the past are no longer
        relevant to gameplay and can be safely discarded.

      <h3 id='data-structure-for-snake-bodies'>Data Structure for Snake
        Bodies</h3>
      <div className='p'>We had three requirements for our snake data
        structure:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast insertion of new coordinates</li>
        <li>Fast deletion of old coordinates</li>
        <li>Fast lookup by TU for collision checking</li>
      </ul>
      <div className='p'>Initially, we implemented snake bodies as queues using
        arrays. This
        gave us the <code>O(1)</code> insertion and deletion we needed, but we
        did not have a correspondence between coordinates and TUs that allowed
        fast lookup by TU.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>Ideally, we wanted to use a linked hash map, which is
        the combination
        of a hash (key-value pairs) and a doubly-linked list with pointers to
        the head (first) and tail (last) elements that allow you to traverse
        through the hash elements in order. However, linked hash maps are not
        natively implemented in JavaScript, so we implemented an approximation
        that fulfills all our requirements:
      </div>
      <SyntaxHighlighter {...syntaxHighlighterProps}>
        {linkedHashMapCode}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>
      <div className='p'>In the structure above, the <code>byKey</code> object
        is a hash where
        TUs are the keys and coordinate pairs are the values.
        The <code>newest</code> and <code>oldest</code> values are simply
        integers that correspond with
        the <code>newest</code> and <code>oldest</code> TUs contained
        in <code>byKey</code>. The TUs in <code>byKey</code> will be sequential
        and will fall within the range defined
        by <code>newest</code> and <code>oldest</code>, so we can
        use <code>newest</code> and <code>oldest</code> as the starting points
        to iterate through the collection starting at the head
        (<code>newest</code>) or tail (<code>oldest</code>) as in a linked list.
        This structure meets all our criteria, giving
        us <code>O(1)</code> lookup by TU, <code>O(1)</code> insertion,
        and <code>O(1)</code>deletion:

      <div className='p'>The game board, which is used for display and for
        collision checking,
        was initially implemented as a sparse matrix using nested arrays:

      <SyntaxHighlighter {...syntaxHighlighterProps}>
        {`board = [[], [undefined, undefined, snake]];
snakeInBoard = board[1][2];`}

      <div className='p'>This provided us <code>O(1)</code> time complexity for
        lookup. However,
        this structure was not very space efficient because we had to insert
        many <code>undefined</code> values and empty arrays in order to shift
        data into the correct indexes.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>We improved the space efficiency by switching to a
        two-dimensional
        hash, eliminating the need for <code>undefined</code> placeholders:

        {`board = { 1: { 2: snake } };
snakeInBoard = board[1][2];`}

      <div className='p'>The only disadvantage to this structure was that
        merging such

        head sets. In other words, snake data is aggregated into head sets as it
        is received, and head sets are subsequently aggregated into boards.
        Because the head sets are reusable for a range of TUs that increases as
        snake lengths increase, using them dramatically improves efficiency of

      <div className='p'>The local snake is not included in the head sets to
        prevent the local
        snake from overwriting another snake’s coordinates, which would
        complicate the detection of collisions. A board that will be used to
        check for collisions should include all head sets (all peer snake
        coordinates) for the relevant TU range, and all of the coordinates for
        the local snake except for the head. If the coordinates of the local
        snake’s head are present in this aggregation (despite the fact that the
        snake’s actual head was excluded from it), then the local snake’s head
        has collided with another snake or another part of its own body.
      </div>
      <div className='p'>In the case of a board that will be used for display,
        we must include
        the relevant head sets, the entire local snake, and predictions for
        missing snake data. Because display boards contain this predicted data,
        they cannot be treated as authoritative and must be discarded when new
        data is received. However, the snake data and head sets are both
        authoritative data, which is why head sets can be used for collision
        checking. Like snake bodies, head sets are also CRDTs, and operations on
        head sets are idempotent, commutative, and associative to protect their
        integrity.

      <div className='row'>
        <div className='eight columns'>
          <div className='p'>When selecting a P2P network topology, our goal was
            to minimize the
            effect of latency as much as possible by eliminating intermediaries
            between peers. The topology that best accomplishes this is a
            fully-connected or full-mesh structure. In this structure, each peer
            is
            connected directly to all other peers with no intermediaries. This
            eliminates the need to relay messages, which would compound latency
            between peers. Although it requires more effort in the initial
            setup,
            once a full-mesh network is in place broadcasting becomes a simple
            matter of iterating through all connections. This model has a higher
            bandwidth overhead because each message is sent individually (no
            message
            aggregation), but this is not a concern for the small, text-based
            messages that are exchanged in Ouroboros.

      <div className='p'>We have chosen game settings to broadly accommodate
        peer groups with
        moderate-to-low latency. If we were able to test the latency
        between peers in a particular group, we could adjust the game settings
        to optimize performance for that specific group. This could be as
        simple as implementing a simple peer-to-peer ping test and developing
        criteria for adjusting game settings accordingly.

      <div className='p'>We are currently using <a
        href='https://github.com/peers'>Peer.js</a>,
        a library that provides a wrapper for the WebRTC API and code to
        broker peer-to-peer connections on our signalling server. Unfortunately,
        Peer.js is not actively mantained and is now woefully out of date. We
        hope that the recent expansion in support for WebRTC will give rise to
        new tools and libraries that we can use to replace Peer.js.

      <h3 id='scaling'>Scaling</h3>
      <div className='p'>Ouroboros currently supports up to 15 players on a
        40x40 grid. Scaling
        up the number of players or expanding the game world would offer several
        interesting challenges. For one, increasing the number of players would
        make our full-mesh peer-to-peer topology impractical. We would need to
        select a new configuration that would reduce the number of peer
        connections while still keeping the number of intermediary nodes to a
        minimum. Changing our topology would also fundamentally change our
        messaging patterns, so we would need to develop a new method of
        aggregating and disseminating peer messages as efficiently as possible.
        Increasing the number of peers would also eventually cause a computation
        bottleneck. We might be able to address this by having peers share
        larger chunks of state (head sets or boards, perhaps) so that local
        computation is reduced. If the playing grid were only one small part of
        a larger game world, we would require an interest algorithm to reduce
        the amount of game state held by each individual player.
